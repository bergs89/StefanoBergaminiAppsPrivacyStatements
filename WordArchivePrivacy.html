<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</em></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Word Archive (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your data when you use our application on macOS. By using Word Archive, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<h3>User-Provided Data</h3>
<p>Word Archive allows you to create and manage personal dictionaries by entering language pairs, words, translations, and associated tags. This data is provided voluntarily and stored only in connection with your use of the app.</p>
<h3>iCloud Storage</h3>
<p>To enhance your experience by syncing your data across your devices, we use Apple’s iCloud service. All word entries, language pairs, and associated metadata are stored in your iCloud account. No personal data beyond what you enter into the app is collected.</p>

<h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
<p>The information you provide is used solely to operate and improve Word Archive. We use your data to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store and manage your custom dictionaries.</li>
  <li>Synchronize your data across your devices using iCloud.</li>
  <li>Enable features such as search, sorting, and data import/export.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p><strong>iCloud Integration:</strong> Your data is securely stored in your iCloud account, managed under Apple’s robust security and privacy guidelines. We rely on Apple’s infrastructure to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data.</p>
<p><strong>Local Security Measures:</strong> We implement standard security measures to protect your data within the app. However, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your iCloud account.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>Word Archive does not share your data with third-party services except as required to use iCloud for data synchronization. Any third-party services used are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information if required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li>Protect and defend our rights or property.</li>
  <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. User Rights</h2>
<p><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You have the right to access, modify, or delete the personal data you provide. You can manage your data directly within the app or through your iCloud account.</p>
<p><strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> You may withdraw your consent to our data practices by discontinuing the use of Word Archive. Please note that this may affect the functionality of the app.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Word Archive is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page along with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
